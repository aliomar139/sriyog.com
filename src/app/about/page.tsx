                Message from The CTO
              </h2>
              <p className="text-[15px]">
                Technology has been connecting everyone from one corner of the globe to another corner in the very fastest way. Businesses and almost all organisations need to have their proper digital presence/ technology adapted in a very effective way and their main motive should be to perform great in  competition and stay ahead. <br />
                <br />
                My journey into the realm of technology began over a decade ago when I founded my first IT startup in 2007 A.D. as PRACAS Infosys in Biratnagar. Recognizing the potential of technology to bridge the gap of digital division and catalyze progress, I always tried to embark on a mission to leverage digital solutions to address local challenges and foster economic development. 
                <br />
                <br />
                My vision was not merely to create successful businesses but to effect meaningful change in my community where I have contributed in more than 500 clients in my entire career spreading 15 countries in the world, developing their website, optimizing search results, developing mobile applications, managing social media, growing their digital presence, providing them a very reliable corporate business email solutions and also providing dedicated Information Technology Consulting Solution. 


                <br />
                <br />
                Having good practices of Information Technology can grow the business faster, gives a great digital presence, saves expensive man hours, optimize workforce, manages data, its privacy and also saves reputation of any organisation for any forthcoming digital disasters like data loss, hacking, identity theft, ransomware attacks and other various issues which we may face anytime, anywhere.
